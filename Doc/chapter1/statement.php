echo " hello world";

# a statement can be written in a line , or in a multiple line . for example,
echo " a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. in this line every english alphabet is used in a sentence and this sebtence contains two line. but we will use only a semicolon to finish this statement . and it is a single statement";
